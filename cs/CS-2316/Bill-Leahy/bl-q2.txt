CS2316 Fall 2015 Practice Quiz 2

1. Here are the rules for leap year:

	A year is a leap year if it is evenly divisible by 4.
	Exception: Years evenly divisible by 100 are not leap years.
	Exception: Years evenly divisible by 400 are leap years.
	
	Write a Python function that will take in a year as a parameter and
	will apply the above rules to return True if the year passed in was
	a leap year and False if not.
	
2. Write a function called isConsonant which will take in a single
   character as a parameter and will return True if it is a consonant
   and False if not. Note: It must work with both upper and lower case
   letters!
	
3. In class we talked about the made up language of Pig Latin. You might
   be surprised to learn that there are other such languages. One is
   called Double Dutch. Here is how it works:

	Vowels remain unchanged. Consonants are doubled and have a u
	inserted between them.
	
	So Bill become Bubilullul.
	Car becomes Cucarur.
	Dog becomes Dudogug
	School becomes Suscuchuhoolul
	
	Write a function that will take in a string as a parameter and will
	convert it into Double Dutch. Note: The string may contain multiple
	words, spaces, punctuation, etc. That should all be left alone. Only
	convert letters per the rules.
	
4. 	Write a function in Python that will take in 3 numbers as
    parameters. The function will return the maximum number. Note: You
    may not use the max function. You must use if-elif-else staements.
    
    
5.  What prints?

	for x in range(1, 21, 4):
	  print(x)
	  
	
	for x in range(-6, -22, -3):
	  print(x)
	  
	  
	for x in range(1, 10, -1):
	  print(x)
