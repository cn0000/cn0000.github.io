1. Look at this csv data. What would this data look like if read into Excel?

Coordinate,X,Y,"Z, datum"
"1,BM",47,12,78
2,22,13,67
3,33,15,76
4,19,23,67
5,46,9,55

2. What would the data look like if read with the Python CSV module
and returned as a list of lists?

3. Write a function to read in the data given the filename. It should
return the data as a list of lists.

4. You have a file of grades for a class. The first row has what each
assignment was (i.e. HW01, QUIZ03). Each student in the class has a row.
Each assignment has a column. Write a function that will be given a
filename. The function will read in the data using the CSV module.

The function will examine the first row and for each column whose header
starts with the letter 'Q' it will calculate the average of values in
that column and then print it to the screen. Then for each row of the
data it will calculate the students average for all items in columns
that start with 'Q'. It will calulate this average normally and also
with the lowest quiz dropped. It will print out two values per student.
