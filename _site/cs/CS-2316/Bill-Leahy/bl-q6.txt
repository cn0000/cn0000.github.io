CS2316 Fall 2015 Practice Quiz 6

1. 	Write a class Triangle. You may assume that you already have the
   	Point Class.

   	Make sure your class has an initializer method as well as a string
   	method, a representation method and an equals method. For each of
   	these methods include a comment as to what the method does and when
   	it will be invoked.

	Your Triangle Class will have as attributes the 3 corners of the
	Triangle.

	Write a method that will calculate and return the perimeter of the
	Triangle.

	Also write a method that will calculate and return the area of the
	Triangle. For the area use this formula (Assume the three vertices
	are a, b and c so that ax will represent the x coordinate of point a
	and ay will represent the y coordinate of point a.

	Area = abs(   ( ax(by-cy) + bx(cy-ay) + cx(ay-by) ) / 2.)

	The Triangle Class will also have its own Turtle which will be
	created by the initializer.

	Implement a method called drawMe which will move the Turtle to point
	a with the pen up then put the pen down and go to point b then to
	point c and then back to point a. Then it should put the pen up.

2. 	What are the three "pillars" of recursion?


3. 	Write a recursive function called evens that will be passed a list
	of ints. The function will return how many of the ints are even.

	Example: evens([4, 7, 1, 5, 6, 3, 22, 7]) will return 3
