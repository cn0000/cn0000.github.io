CS2316 Fall 2015 Practice Quiz 10

1. Write a function that will take in as an argument a URL. The function
will read the URL into memory and then see if it contains the phone
number of the White House: 202-456-1111 (in exactly that format).
It should return True or False. Don't use regular expressions.



2. Write a function that will take in a URL and a search string. The
function will open the URL, read it into memory and then search for the
search string. For each occurence found it will print from about 20
characters before the location until about 20 characters after the end
of the search string that was found. If there are not 20 characters
before then just start at the beginning of the text. Likewise if there
are not 20 characters after the end of the search term just print until
the end of the text. Don't use regular expressions.
